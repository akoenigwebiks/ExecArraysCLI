            # C# Array Exercises for Beginners

            ## Exercise 1: Sum of Elements
                 **Objective:**Create a C# console application that initializes an array with integers and calculates the sum of its elements.
            ```csharp
            // Initialize an array with sample integers.
            // Write code to calculate the sum of the elements in the array.
            // Print the sum to the console.
            ```

                 */

            ## Exercise 1: Sum of Elements
                        **Objective:**Create a C# console application that initializes an array with integers and calculates the sum of its elements.
            ```csharp
            // Initialize an array with sample integers.
            // Write code to calculate the sum of the elements in the array.
            // Print the sum to the console.
            ```

            ## Exercise 2: Average of Numbers
            **Objective:**Write a program that calculates the average of the numbers stored in an array.
            ```csharp
            // Declare and initialize an array with integers.
            // Calculate the average of these numbers.
            // Print the average to the console.
            ```

            ## Exercise 3: Find the Maximum
            **Objective:**Develop a C# program that finds the maximum value in an array of integers.
            ```csharp
            // Initialize an array with integers.
            // Write a loop to determine the maximum value in the array.
            // Print the maximum value to the console.
            ```

            ## Exercise 4: Reverse Array
            **Objective:**Implement a program in C# that reverses the elements of an array without using a built-in method.
            ```csharp
            // Declare and initialize an array with integers.
            // Create logic to reverse the array manually.
            // Print the reversed array to the console.
            ```

            ## Exercise 5: Contains a Specific Value
            **Objective:**Create a console application that checks whether a specific value exists within an array.
            ```csharp
            // Initialize an array with some integers.
            // Ask the user to input a number from the console.
            // Check if the array contains this number.
            // Print a message to the console indicating whether the number is found or not.
            ```

            Exercise 6: Matrix Addition
            Objective: Create a C# console application that initializes two 2x2 matrices and calculates their sum.

            csharp
            Copy code
            // Declare two 2x2 matrices and initialize them with sample values.
            // Write code to add these matrices.
            // Print the resultant matrix to the console.
            Exercise 7: Diagonal Sum of a Square Matrix
            Objective: Write a program that calculates the sum of the diagonal elements of a 3x3 matrix.

            csharp
            Copy code
            // Declare and initialize a 3x3 matrix with integers.
            // Calculate the sum of the diagonal elements (i.e., where the row index equals the column index).
            // Print the sum to the console.
            */

        }
    }
